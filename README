flatdeb
=======

flatdeb is a proof of concept for building Flatpak runtimes and apps
from Debian packages.

Walkthrough
-----------

On a Debian 9 VM (assuming username "user"):

    adduser user sudo
    visudo          # and set %sudo ALL=(ALL:ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL
    sensible-editor /etc/apt/sources.list    # and enable backports
    apt install debootstrap openssh-server sudo systemd-container time
    apt install -t stretch-backports flatpak flatpak-builder ostree
    passwd user     # and have a password

Make sure the VM's /tmp is large and mounted with the "dev" option,
and that its /var/tmp is large and supports extended attributes.

On the host system (or the VM if you're running everything there):

    apt install python3 python3-debian python3-gi python3-yaml sshfs

You need an apt-cacher-ng on http://192.168.122.1:3142 (currently
hard-coded), visible to both the host system and the VM. If you don't
have that, edit run.py accordingly.

Also edit org.debian.packages.openarena.yaml to specify where you have
put local clones of ioquake3 and openarena if you can't (or don't
want to) clone them via https.

$HOME/.cache/flatdeb on the host system also needs to be made available
to both the host system and the VM via HTTP, at
http://192.168.122.1:3142/local/flatdeb (again currently hard-coded). A
convenient way to do this is to make it a symlink to a directory that is
exported via apt-cacher-ng's LocalDirs directive:

    $ cat /etc/apt-cacher-ng/local.conf
    LocalDirs: local /srv/acng/local
    $ ls -l ~/.cache/flatdeb
    lrwxrwxrwx ... /home/user/.cache/flatdeb -> /srv/acng/local/flatdeb

Finally, put a copy of debian-archive-keyring.gpg in this directory.

On the host (assuming VM is "ikea.virt"):

    ssh-copy-id ikea.virt
    ./run.py --remote=ikea.virt --suite=stretch --arch=amd64 base
    ./run.py --remote=ikea.virt --suite=stretch --arch=amd64 runtimes \
        runtimes/net.debian.flatpak.Base.yaml
    ./run.py --remote=ikea.virt --suite=stretch --arch=amd64 runtimes \
        runtimes/net.debian.flatpak.Games.yaml
    ./run.py --remote=ikea.virt --suite=stretch --arch=amd64 app \
        apps/org.debian.packages.hello.yaml
    ./run.py --remote=ikea.virt --suite=stretch --arch=amd64 app \
        apps/org.debian.packages.openarena.yaml
    ./run.py --remote=ikea.virt --suite=stretch --arch=amd64 app \
        apps/org.debian.packages.mesa_utils.yaml

On the host, or a test machine onto which you have copied
`$HOME/.cache/flatdeb/repo` with `rsync` or similar:

    flatpak --user remote-add --no-gpg-verify flatdeb $HOME/.cache/flatdeb/repo
    flatpak --user install flatdeb org.debian.packages.hello
    flatpak run org.debian.packages.hello
    flatpak --user install flatdeb org.debian.packages.openarena
    flatpak run org.debian.packages.openarena

(Or run it all on the VM, without `--remote` - less well-tested.)
